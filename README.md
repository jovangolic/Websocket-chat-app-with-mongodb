# Project Websocket-chat-app-with-mongodb
One On One Chat application with Spring boot & WebSocket & MongoDB

## Overview
One-to-one-chat-app is java web application that allows you to comumnicate with other users. It is websocket application. WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables two-way communication between client and server over a single, persistent TCP connection. Unlike classic HTTP, where communication takes place on the basis of requests and responses, WebSocket allows the server to send data to the client without the need for the client to send a request first.
MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that enables data storage and management in a flexible, scalable and high-performance environment. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and SQL to manage data, MongoDB uses documents in the BSON (Binary JSON) format and JSON-like structures, which enables the storage of complex and heterogeneous data.
